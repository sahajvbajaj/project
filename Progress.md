#Day1(31st oct)
Read the PS thoroughly, planned on how to do things where and what do i need to do
#Day2(1st nov)
Completed all my learning part. learned the working,the needs for components,circuit design,questioned some cases. 
#Day3(2nd nov)
Worked on simulation of H bridge. encounter with some problems which i struggling to work with
image1-my circuit for h bridge<img width="1717" height="1385" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-02 192701" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a54eac-9629-409b-9109-2344b7c94d76" />

image2 shows the current through motor. which is as i expected.<img width="2879" height="1020" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-02 190114" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91758f87-8646-4a78-83a5-bd180ccfef8d" />
Day4(last day 3rd nov)
worked further with torque feedback and current sensing.<img width="1384" height="982" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1470a0e5-c941-48f6-a91b-6d4f39bba7cc" />
